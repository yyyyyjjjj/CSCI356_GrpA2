  - So, you've made it this far. Impressive. But don't think for a moment that your
    journey will get any easier from here.
  - This is the Isle of Trials, where the strong are separated from the weak. The
    enemies here are relentless, and the puzzles will test your very resolve.
  - "I once stood where you are now, but I failed to complete my quest. If you can
    conquer this island, you\u2019ll be one step closer to fulfilling your destiny."
