  - "You\u2019ve arrived at last, hero. Congratulations! Few have made it this far.
    This is the Isle of Destiny, where your journey ends... or begins anew."
  - Beyond this point lies the final trial. The air is thick with the presence of
    the one who has cast this shadow over the islands. The ancient evil awaits you,
    and only by defeating it can peace be restored.
  - "The final battle is near. Find the boss that haunts this island, and give it
    everything you\u2019ve got. Good luck, hero. The fate of the islands rests with
    you."
