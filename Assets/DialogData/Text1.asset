  dialog:
  - Welcome, brave traveler, to the Isle of Beginnings. Long ago, this land was peaceful,
    but darkness has begun to creep across the volcano. The ancient prophecy foretold
    of a hero who would rise to bring balance to the islands. That hero is you.
  - Your journey will take you across three islands, each with its own trials. On
    this island, you will learn the ways of combat, explore ancient ruins, and gather
    strength for the challenges ahead.
  - Remember, courage and wisdom are your greatest allies. The path may be treacherous,
    but the fate of the islands rests in your hands. Now, go forth, and may the spirits
    guide you.
